// Zombie: As an undead, it inherits all the common characteristics of the undead class. Zombie can eat another undead as a result it will increase its HP by the half of the HP of the undead being eaten. Zombie may attack other undead. Its attack damage is half of its HP. Zombie could only attack if its HP is greater than 50. If the zombieâ€™s HP is reduced to 0, it will die. On creation, zombie has the default HP of the undead.
